# Python exercise

## Prequisites

* make sure you have Python 3 and that you're using it
* `make`(1)
* make sure you have a sensible Python editor; VS Code recommended, or PyCharm if you have a license for it

## Setup

Do this ahead of the interview, in case it doesn't go 100% smoothly!

* Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/CRUKorg/interview-exercises.git`
* Make a new branch for the interviewee to work in: `git checkout -b <Workday Candidate ID>`
* Open `example/__init__.py` in the editor
* Check that the tests pass cleanly by running them:

``` shellsession
âž­ make test
python3 -m unittest discover --verbose --start-directory tests/
test_palindrome (test_palindrome.Test) ... ok

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 1 test in 0.000s

OK
```

## Interview procedure

### Standard mandatory questions

A great deal of cancer research is carried out without using animals but in certain areas itâ€™s still necessary if we are to understand, prevent and cure cancer. CRUK only uses animals when there is no alternative. Does this cause you any problems?

Cancer Research UK operates a strict Non Smoking policy â€“ would you have any issues adhering to this?

### Prerequisites

* the candidate will need a GitHub account (VS Code Live Share might work with a Microsoft account, but this is untested)
* they can use the fat VS Code app, or the web client

### Introduction

> We're going to solve a problem together; we would like a bit of Python to generate the Fibonacci sequence. We've got a little skeleton with some tests; let's get an editor going and have a look."

* open the editor
* show the source code; `exercise/__init__.py`
* start live share
  * âŒ˜â‡§P / live share: start collaboration session
  * sign in with Microsoft
  * paste the invite (a `visualstudio.com` URL) into whatever chat you have going with the candidate
  https://prod.liveshare.vsengsaas.visualstudio.com/join?DF6041E8734FBC909D034CE2DD1411A10FC2
  * get them to do Hamburger / View / Terminal
* remember there is the audio optionâ€”use the menu on the ðŸŽ– status bar at the bottom of the editor window
* run the tests: `make`

* Hand them the (virtual) keyboard: "GO!"

### The exercise

* write a fibonacci() method; our requirements are:
  * When we pass the function some number n we expect it to return the number that is in position n in the sequence, with the zeroth number being 1.
  * Our function should raise a ValueError if we pass in a number less than 0 because it makes no sense to have anything before the zeroth position in the sequence.

### Wrap-up

* check their work in to the branch `git commit -m "exercise finished" .`
* push the branch to upstream `git push`
* you might like to `make lint` to see what flake8 thinks
