# UI Tests

Your task is to create automated checks for the search function for the CRUK find a shop page ([https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/get-involved/find-a-shop](https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/get-involved/find-a-shop)).

## Scenarios

You need to test the following scenarios (this is a live website, please don't overuse the page/functionality):

1. create a "happy path" scenario.
1. create a negative scenario.

## Guidance

If you prefer to use a different test framework (feel free to add it as a dependency, we use Cypress.io at CRUK) to solve the challenge. Use best practices for the test architecture and setup.

### Setup
Please upgrade the Cypress version if you want/need features
```sh
npm install
```

### Run
Launch Cypress GUI
```sh
npm run cypress:open
```
or headless
```sh
npm test
```

## Documentation

Please describe in a README.md file how to run the tests and any other additional info needed about any assumptions you make.

1. Zip up the project and send it back to the hiring manager
1. Publish to your github and send us the link
