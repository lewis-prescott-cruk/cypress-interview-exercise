# Interview exercises

Here are some interview exercises.

## How to use

* Keep the `master` branch clean.
* Make a new branch for each interviewee; use their Workday candidate ID, not their name.
* Let them manage their branch as they like…
* …but make sure there's at least one commit at the end of their interview!
