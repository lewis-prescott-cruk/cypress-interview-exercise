# Interview exercises

Here are some interview exercises.

## How to use

* Keep the `master` branch clean.
* Make a new branch for each interviewee; use their Workday candidate ID, not their name.
* Let them manage their branch as they like…
* …but make sure there's at least one commit, at the end of their interview!

## Set the tone

As you conduct the exercise, remember that you are trying to give them a controlled, safe environment where they can demonstrate their skills. Interviews should not be a ritual hazing. You are solving a problem together.

If they ask, I'd personally be happy to let them use online resources to help—but not impressed by them just "searching for the answer" and paste that in!

## Get ready before you start

* Make sure the prerequisites are satisfied before you begin
* Disable alerts, notifications and whatnot on your laptop
* Close all apps but the code editor, and perhaps a terminal
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) is probably a good choice of editor; on a Mac with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) `brew install visual-studio-code`

### How to do remote pairing with VS Code

* `⌘⇧P` Live Share: Start Collaboration Session (Share)
* copy the link to your clipboard
* Open folder… / `/interview-exercises/`
* `⌘⇧P` Git: Create branch… / `YYYY-MM-DD-name`
 Make sure you're branching off master.
* Open this `README.md` in VS Code
* Start a terminal `⌃⇧`` to help run the tests (you'll need to grant the candidate permission to use this)
* Do the exercise!
